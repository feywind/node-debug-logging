# GCP Debug Logger Proposal

A very simple proposal of how we might add some flexible debug logging to our libraries with very little overhead (and also plug into existing popular libraries). This proposal is in Node specifically, but could be expanded to browsers and other languages.

This one file library would export a function that creates a debug logger. It takes in a namespace designation and returns a function you can call to log to that namespace. This is a very simple surface based on the built-in Node `util.debugLog` function, and the `debug` npm library.

It gives us several advantages over just using one of those:

* Non-dogmatic: Use whatever underlying library you like for the actual output / log gathering / etc
* Very small footprint: Requires no dependencies and is one small JS module
* Auto plugs into whatever the user is using: just `npm i debug` and it'll find it and adjust; may add others later
* Unified variables: This uses the standard namespace syntax like `NODE_DEBUG` or `DEBUG`, but it can pull values from a unified `GCP_DEBUG` used across many languages into those other packages' variables
* Following on from that: GCP gets to be in control of the ultimate surface presented to users, so we can make it work across many languages and libraries (e.g. Python could also look for `GCP_DEBUG` in the same format)
* Allows programmatic log sinks: Any other module or library may create a namespaced logger and call EventEmitter methods on it. These instances are shared, so you'll get the same logger as the library calling it to produce logs
